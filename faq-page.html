        <strong>How Do I Add My Household to the Map?</strong><br>
        You can add yourself to the map using the sign up form. On the form, you’ll be given the option of including just yourself or multiple members of your household.
    </div>
        <div class="paragraph-items"><strong>How Can Others Find Me on the Web?</strong><br>
        Your email address can be used to locate your household once you’ve added it to the map. Anyone who knows your email address can locate your information, so please be certain you are comfortable with sharing it as associated with that email. If you do not want anyone with your email to be able to find you, we recommend creating a different email account to use for the isolation web which you can share directly with members of your community.   
    </div>
        <div class="paragraph-items"><strong>Why Are Households Anonymized?</strong><br>
        Households are automatically anonymized to protect those who don’t wish their information to be shared completely publicly. To find other households in your social network, you can add them by entering their email address.
    </div>
        <div class="paragraph-items"><strong>Why Can’t People Find Me By Name or Via Social Media?</strong><br>
        To protect people’s privacy, we decided to not allow a search by name feature. Only individuals who know the email address you used to sign up for the web can locate you. 
    </div>
        <div class="paragraph-items"><strong>I’m A Developer or Designer With a Feature Request. Can I Help With This Project?</strong><br>
        Yes! Please! This is an open source project and we welcome contributions and ideas. All of the code for the Isolation Web can be found on our Github <a href="https://github.com/tembahisarms/Isolation-Web">here</a>.
