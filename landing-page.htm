            <h2>Help Keep Each Other Safe</h2>
            <p>During the COVID-19 health crisis, many find themselves torn between the need to be with loved ones, and the need to separate themselves in order to protect their community. In facing this new reality, we must question not just whether to isolate ourselves, but exactly how much. The Isolation Web hopes to empower people with information about that potential impact and to help them make informed decisions that align with their values.</p>
